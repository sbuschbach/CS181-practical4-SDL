To run our source code for the model-free implementation, simply run "python model_free_RUN_ME.py". Likewise, run "python model_based.py", although, as we stated in our writeup, this model was not successfully implemented in the end.

The rest of the files are either implement the supporting files or the SwingyMonkey game. 


-> model_based.py : implementation of the model-based solution
-> model_free_RUN_ME.py : implementation of the model-free solution
-> README : this file
-> res : resources required to run the SwingyMonkey game
-> SwingyMonkey.py : implementation of the SwingyMonkey game
-> writeup.pdf : the Practical writeup
